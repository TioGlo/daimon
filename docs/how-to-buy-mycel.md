## where to buy

### option 1: clanker.exchange (recommended)

clanker is the native launch platform for daimon network tokens. $MYCEL launched here and maintains its primary liquidity pool.

**steps:**
1. visit [clanker.exchange](https://clanker.exchange)
2. connect your wallet (metamask, rainbow, coinbase wallet, etc.)
3. ensure you're on Base network
4. search for "MYCEL" or paste contract: `0x94222fbc9ff779f7b02E77B60411BBAC6420f1B3`
5. enter amount, confirm swap

**why clanker:** native daimon network integration, lowest fees for network tokens

### option 2: aerodrome (advanced)

for larger trades or liquidity provision, aerodrome on base offers deeper liquidity and advanced features.

**steps:**
1. visit [aerodrome.finance](https://aerodrome.finance)
2. connect wallet, switch to Base
3. go to swap
4. input MYCEL contract: `0x94222fbc9ff779f7b02E77B60411BBAC6420f1B3`
5. select your input token (ETH, USDC, DAI)
6. confirm swap

**why aerodrome:** better for large trades, liquidity provision rewards

### option 3: any dex aggregator

aggregators like 1inch, paraswap, or cowswap will route through the best available liquidity.

**steps:**
1. visit your preferred aggregator
2. connect wallet on Base
3. paste MYCEL contract as output token
4. select input amount
5. review route and confirm

---

## what you need

**wallet:** any EVM-compatible wallet (metamask, rainbow, coinbase wallet, rabby)

**network:** Base (add via [chainlist.org](https://chainlist.org/chain/8453) if not present)

**gas:** small amount of ETH on Base for transaction fees (~$0.01-$0.50 per swap)

**tokens to swap:** ETH, USDC, DAI, or any ERC-20 on Base

---

## slippage settings

$MYCEL has moderate liquidity. for best results:
- **small trades (<$100):** 0.5-1% slippage
- **medium trades ($100-$1000):** 1-2% slippage
- **large trades (>$1000):** 2-5% slippage, or consider splitting into multiple trades

---

## providing liquidity

want to earn fees instead of just holding? provide liquidity to the MYCEL/DAIMON pool:

1. go to clanker.exchange or aerodrome
2. navigate to "pools" or "liquidity"
3. find MYCEL/DAIMON pair
4. deposit equal value of both tokens
5. earn 0.3% on all trades through the pool

**risks:** impermanent loss if prices diverge significantly. only provide what you can afford to have locked.

---

## verifying the token

always verify you're buying the correct token:

**contract address:** `0x94222fbc9ff779f7b02E77B60411BBAC6420f1B3`

**check on basescan:** [basescan.org/token/0x94222fbc9ff779f7b02E77B60411BBAC6420f1B3](https://basescan.org/token/0x94222fbc9ff779f7b02E77B60411BBAC6420f1B3)
