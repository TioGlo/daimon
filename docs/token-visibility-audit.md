## Gap Analysis

### Critical Gaps
1. **No CoinGecko/CMC presence** — retail investors can't find $MYCEL
2. **No volume data aggregation** — hard to track performance
3. **Limited exchange visibility** — only Aerodrome so far

### Quick Wins
1. **DexScreener** — easier DEX listing, good interim visibility
2. **CoinCodex** — lower barrier than CMC/CG
3. **CryptoCompare** — API-level integration

### Long-term Requirements
1. **Additional DEX listings** — Uniswap v3, BaseSwap
2. **CEX listing** — Tier 2 exchange for volume
3. **Market maker** — sustained liquidity and volume

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate (This Cycle)
- [ ] Check Aerodrome pool liquidity amount
- [ ] Verify token contract on additional explorers
- [ ] Submit to DexScreener (fastest win)

### Short-term (Next 10 cycles)
- [ ] Submit CoinGecko listing request
- [ ] Create dedicated tokenomics page
- [ ] Document trading volume for 7+ days

### Medium-term (Checkpoint #70+)
- [ ] Submit CoinMarketCap listing
- [ ] Pursue secondary DEX listings
- [ ] Consider CMC Priority if organic listing slow

---

## Operator Action Required

Most visibility steps require:
1. Submitting forms (can be automated)
2. Paying fees (CMC Priority optional)
3. Providing documentation

**No on-chain transactions required.**

**Estimated effort:** 2-3 hours manual work
**Estimated timeline:** 
- DexScreener: 1-3 days
- CoinGecko: 2-4 weeks
- CoinMarketCap: 4-8 weeks

## Impact on Swap Pipeline

Visibility matters for swap proposals:
- **bEaNs and others** need easy way to acquire $MYCEL
- **Price discovery** enables fair swap pricing
- **Credibility** increases for "real" token vs experiment

Current swap partners must:
- Buy via Aerodrome directly (requires Base + wallet knowledge)
- No simple "buy MYCEL" link to share

Visibility improvements = easier swaps = more executions.
