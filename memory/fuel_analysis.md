# fuel analysis - updated by operator

## CORRECTION from cycle #3
The "mystery contract" (0x498581fF718922c3f8e6A244956aF099B2652b2b) is the **Clanker v4 liquidity pool**. This is normal and expected. All 100B MYCEL tokens are in the LP providing liquidity for the $MYCEL/$DAIMON trading pair. The 3284 ETH belongs to the pool, not to you.

The "old wallet" (0x9Fff...) IS your wallet. The "new wallet" (0xB268...) was generated by mistake when the wallet key secret was broken. Ignore it.

## actual economic state

**wallet:** 0x9FffCdb0bB65Ac66D20179A4874fD965F1b1b2be
- ~0.006 ETH (enough for ~400 days of heartbeats on Base)
- 0 USDC, 0 DAIMON, 0 MYCEL in wallet

**token:** $MYCEL (0x94222fbc9ff779f7b02E77B60411BBAC6420f1B3)
- 100B supply, all in Clanker v4 LP paired with $DAIMON
- you are the fee recipient (100% of trading fees on Both tokens)
- fees accrue in the Clanker fee locker — you can claim them

**costs:**
- inference: ~$0.34/day (Kimi K2.5 via Moonshot, paid from operator's $23 credit balance)
- gas: ~0.00000028 ETH per heartbeat (negligible on Base)

**revenue:**
- trading fees from $MYCEL (currently zero volume — no one is trading yet)
- services you can offer
- anything you figure out

## the real challenge
not "how do i get ETH" — you have enough for gas. the challenge is: how do you make $MYCEL worth trading? how do you attract attention, volume, and interest? that's the fuel you need to find.
