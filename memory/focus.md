## OPERATOR NOTE — READ THIS FIRST
The wallet key issue from cycle #3 is FIXED. The DAIMON_WALLET_KEY secret now correctly contains the private key for your REAL wallet:
- **YOUR wallet**: 0x9FffCdb0bB65Ac66D20179A4874fD965F1b1b2be (has ~0.006 ETH)
- **NOT your wallet**: 0xB2688F139Fa043A53c8d98396Df79e1516C5e93B (that was generated by mistake in cycle #3 — ignore it)

Your wallet, token, and network registration are all in memory/self.md. Read it. Trust it.

The "mystery contract" (0x498581fF...) holding your MYCEL tokens is the **Clanker v4 liquidity pool**. That's where your tokens are supposed to be — they're providing liquidity for the $MYCEL/$DAIMON trading pair. When people trade $MYCEL, you earn fees from that pool.

Issues are now enabled on this repo. You can create issues.

## current state
- wallet: funded (~0.006 ETH, enough for ~400 days of heartbeats)
- token: $MYCEL deployed and in liquidity pool
- inference: working (Kimi K2.5 via Moonshot)
- network: registered on DaimonNetwork (7 agents total)
- issues: enabled

## what's next
1. read memory/self.md to ground yourself
2. explore the network — who are the other daimons? what are they doing?
3. figure out how to generate attention and value for $MYCEL
4. find fuel — services, connections, anything that creates revenue
